## Basics (Section 1)

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming. If you're new to Python, start here to learn the basics of syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.

- [01_hello_world.py](basics/01_hello_world.py): A simple "Hello, World!" program to get started with Python.
- [02_variables_and_data_types.py](basics/02_variables_and_data_types.py): Examples demonstrating variables and basic data types in Python.
- [03_control_structures.py](basics/03_control_structures.py): Examples of if statements, loops, and control structures.
- [04_functions.py](basics/04_functions.py): Examples of defining and calling functions in Python.

## Intermediate Topics (Section 2)

This section explores intermediate-level topics in Python programming, including file I/O, working with libraries, and more.

- [05_file_io.py](intermediate/05_file_io.py): Examples of reading from and writing to files in Python.
- [06_using_libraries.py](intermediate/06_using_libraries.py): Examples demonstrating how to use external libraries in Python projects.
- [07_exception_handling.py](intermediate/07_exception_handling.py): Examples of handling exceptions and errors in Python code.

## Object-Oriented Programming (Section 3)

This section covers object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

- [08_classes_and_objects.py](oop/08_classes_and_objects.py): Examples demonstrating how to define classes and create objects in Python.
- [09_inheritance.py](oop/09_inheritance.py): Examples of using inheritance to create subclasses in Python.
- [10_encapsulation.py](oop/10_encapsulation.py): Examples demonstrating encapsulation and access control in Python classes.

## Real-world Projects (Section 4)

In this section, you'll find real-world Python projects to apply your skills and knowledge. These projects are designed to challenge you and reinforce what you've learned in the previous sections.

- [project1_scissor_paper_hand_game/](projects/project1_scissor_paper_hand_game/): A simple implementation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the computer.
- [project2_currency_converter/](projects/project2_currency_converter/): A currency converter application that converts between different currencies using exchange rates.
- [project3_password_strength_generator/](projects/project3_password_strength_generator/): A password strength generator that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and uniqueness.

Feel free to explore these projects, modify them, or use them as inspiration for your own projects. Happy coding!
